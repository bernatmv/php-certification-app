I would say that it's 1. as<br/>2. is true because SAX does create a tree model<br/>3. is true because SAX does not need to keep the whole XML in memory<br/>4. is true because SAX calls methods for every open/close tag (SAX only makes it easier to develop own parsers, not to work with XML in general!)
