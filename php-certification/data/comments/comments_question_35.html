you can only have one parent, you can implement more than one interface and have more than one child, so you can save yourself some thinking and choose 4 by elimination

For me this was hard to answer because the language used is vague. If it would have said it can implement several interfaces, then the answer is obvious. That's why I answered through a process of elimination. I certainly hope the real test has clearer verbiage than this.

Class can have multiple children and interfaces but only one direct parent. So answer is 4: interfaces, parent
