${0x0} curly braces used for complex coding in PHP 5.x.<br/><br/>So, @ uses for debugging mostly, & ampersand uses for reference variable, curly braces for complex definition and 4th one is standard simple definition.

@$foo is a valid $foo variable with the @ error control operator  attached to it. <br/>&$variable is a valid $variable variable with the & reference operator attached to it.<br/>${0x0} uses a valid curly braces syntax. Anything inside {} will be interpolated. So 0x0 will be interpolated to 0 and stored as a variable with the name 0.

the question doesn't ask which are valid variable names, only which are valid variables. Following this logic, 1,2,3,4 are all valid. But could someone please explain #3..

1 and 2 are not valid names too, as @ and & does not add up to name in any way. Those are language oparators IMHO

I tested 1,2,3,4 are valid. 5 is invalid because it start with number 0.

$0x0 is invalid, cause vairbales are not allowed to begin with a number.
