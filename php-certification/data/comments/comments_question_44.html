Answer 1 is correct. Only trusted var would be _SESSION. People say that 5 might be correct, but _SERVER contains user input like the GET / POST vars which can be manipulated by the client.

1 is correct.  Some $_SERVER contents can be manipulated.

I will go with 1) none of the above. The only super global to trust (all though bad programming habit) is the one that is generated by the dev / app ($_SESSIONS) but you will still need to compare. so all other $_XXXXXX cannot be trusted

Obviously the answer is 1, $_ENV is mentioned in the docs why it is insecure, $_SERVER is also not secure, for example directly using $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] can be used by malicious users.

not all $_SERVER values can be trusted, some rely on the header values sent by the browser.

As written in the php documentation $_ENV is not a trusted source. I think the right answer is 1
