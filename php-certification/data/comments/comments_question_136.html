<p>
no no, it's the same result in PHP 4.4.X and PHP 5. So 4 only.

2 and 4.  The difference in PHP 5 is that the foreach construct now supports by-reference declaration of the value element.  The $z[] =& $y; statement will not pass by reference in PHP 4, and thus, the array will remain unchanged.

I have checked on php 4.4.9 and php 5.2.11 and result was the same: array('c', 'c', 'c')
