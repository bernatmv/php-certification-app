2 will never be the correct answer, it uses strtolower, so the name will always be lowercase and it tries to match with something with capital letters in.

== is for equivalent, not identical

The question is in IDENTICAL copy of the code. get_class() in PHP 4 returns class name in lowercase, but in PHP 5 it returns name as it was declared. So to indentically copy code we must use 2 answer, but NOT 5 one.

The correct answer is 2. Original condition will never evaluate to true in PHP4 because get_class() in PHP4 returns class name in lower case letters. So it'll never be equal to 'MyClass'. While 5th condition (myObj instanceof MyClass) will evaluate to true if $myObj is an instance of MyClass which makes code do not perform identical to original. In addition strtolower(get_class()) of PHP5 is identical to get_class() of PHP4.

I think #5. How could forced-lowercase ever match "MyClass" including uppercase chars?

In PHP4 is_a() would have been the equivalent to 5. So 2. really seems the correct one.

Prior to PHP5, get_class returned the class name in lower case letters. So, the answer is 2, if we want to reproduce the function exactly, in my opinion.
