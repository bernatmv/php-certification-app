depends on which framework, cakephp for example does not have a front controller. ZF does.

When you move all requests to index.php file using .htaccess this is called Front Controller.<br/>Or in other words single entry point.<br/><br/>So correct are 1, 2, 4, 5

IMHO there shouldn't be a 4. answer at all. Front Controller is a Enterprise Architecture Pattern of its own and Validation is not even mentioned on the Wikipedia MVC page.
