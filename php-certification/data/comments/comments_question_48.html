If you was enabled <br/>the session.use_only_cookies or session.use_cookies <br/>it can not be.<br/>Even if these directives was disabled, you can simply open request http://www.zend.com/?PHPSESSID=123 <br/>and it does not matter, <br/>because server doesn't have session id is 123.<br/>We can not change directly session id and keep previous session data.<br/>Then I think true answer is 1.
