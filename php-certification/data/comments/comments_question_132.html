4 and 5 is the right answers. PHP itself is the best template engine.

Not 1,2,3,4. Must be Smarty since if is a suite of "template' conversion classes. templates are for views. so 5 is corrrect.

5 is true for sure . 1,2 are not an option . imho 4 is the other one since Views in the MVC pattern should contain no logic and be "stupid" pages
