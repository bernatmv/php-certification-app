magic_quotes_gpc should be disabled to ensure proper using of native database escape string functions..

<p>
why should I disable magic_quotes_gpc to improve the security? some use the the function for protecting databases of sql injections.. and I also would not disable safe_mode because it will improve security.. so even if I should choose 4 answers, I would only choose 3,4,5

Exactly how does disabling safe_mode or magic_quotes_gpc improve the outward security of your application? (Forgetting for a moment that they are both deprecated as of PHP 5.3.0) One of them will have to be chosen since the question requires four answers. 3,4,5 are slam-dunk for sure, no need to debate correct choices though in my opinion.

I agree with, the correct answer is : 1,3,4,5

2,3,4, and 5 are correct.  In response to Seal, http://us2.php.net/manual/en/security.magicquotes.php

trick question.<br/>the question says - directives should be disabled to improve the outward security...<br/><br/>Note the keyword DISABLED<br/><br/>so I will go with 1, 3, 4, 5,<br/>magic_quotes_gpc - this needs to be enabled to improve outward security. And even then its not 100% because this function only escapes some characters - programmer would still need to escape some special charaters<br/>

Roy, display_errors can contain data which can reveal sensitive information about your application, such as information about the setup of your database which could lead to a further security breach such as an sql injection attack.<br/><br/>The correct answers are 2,3,4,5

Everybody knows that "safe_mode" gives the false sense of security so it won't matter, so the correct answers are 2,3,4,5

I disagree with display errors. i agree it helps debugging. how does that improve security?

cmon, display_errors at least should be one of them.
