1 is right : headers_list â€” Returns a list of response headers sent (or ready to send)

The answers provided are incorrect. Answer #1 checks if the "Location:{$url}" header was added to the headers list, not if it was sent to the browser. The check if the headers were sent (and trying to set more headers would result in a "Headers already sent" error, you can use headers_sent() ).

#1 is a correct answer. RTFM http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.headers-list.php headers_list() Returns a list of response headers sent (or ready to send). http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.headers-list.php

1. is right here, thought we can use headers_sent() to determine.

These answers are wrong, the following should be used:<br/><br/>if (!headers_sent()) {<br/>    header('Location: http://www.example.com/');<br/>    exit;<br/>}
