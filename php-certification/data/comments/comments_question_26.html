<p>
the word operator is confusing. if instanceof is an operator than right answer is 2. Because === will check not only the type but also the properties values. which might be different.

It's 2 of course. They are looking for the TYPE of the object. Only instanceof can do that. (from the given options)<br/>instanceof is used to determine whether a PHP variable is an instantiated object of a certain class

Are the answers sometimes shown in different order? :)<br/>The correct answer is 2. "instanceof and type-hinting" because "===" does check for identical objects not for the inherited class and "type-hinting" is the only thing that may be part of the function declaration.<br/>

The correct answer is NOT 4. '===' checks if two variable contain the same INSTANCE of an object whereas instanceof checks if the variable is an instance of a particular class. Ie is of a certain type.

The first blank refer to "operator", so i think that is 4.
