3 is right, all the other 1,4,5 give syntax errors<br/><br/>still even 3 needs the $a variable instantiated !<br/><br/>code example : <br/><br/>class MyClass {<br/>    <br/>    public function getInstance (){<br/>        return $this;<br/>    }<br/>    <br/>    public function doSomething (){<br/>        echo "something";<br/>    }<br/>}<br/>    $a = new Myclass();<br/>    $c = $a->getInstance()->doSomething();<br/><br/>//prints something<br/>

3 is correct, but $a needs the new MyClass.. http://codepad.viper-7.com/qwOiUH

This is testing "dereferencing returned objects." You couldn't do this in PHP4. In PHP4, you had to save the returned object as a variable 1st. In PHP 5, you don't. So, the answer is 3. By the way, 1, 4, & 5 cause syntax errors. You can't cast a variable as an object of a class. Duh, only as an object... and you certainly can't do it while calling a method.

I think that 4 is probable correct but variable 'a' has not been instantiated. A more correct answer would be $c = MyClass::getInstance()->doSomething(). but this depends on MyClass being created as a singleton.

right answer $c = $a->getInstance()->doSomething();
