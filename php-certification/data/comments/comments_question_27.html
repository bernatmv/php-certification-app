There is nothing wrong with this code, it executes without any problems. The name of the function is a bit odd though, because it does not exactly duplicate an object.

How to assume that the programmer is trying to _Clone_ the object in the given code?

There's nothing 'wrong' with this code, it might just not do what you expect!

When you assign an object from one variable to another, you do not copy it, but merely assign a handle or reference to it. When actually want to assign a full copy of an existing object to a new variable. This is known as cloning, and is done via the clone operator. i.e. $newObj = clone $obj;

When you assign an object from one variable to another, you do not copy it, but merely assign a handle or reference to it. Statement $newObj = $obj; will not create a new copy of the object. It will assign the reference of  object to $newObj. to make a duplicate copy use clone operator. i.e $newObj = clone $obj;
