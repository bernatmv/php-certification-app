In fact ... In PHP5 answer would be 20, 20, since objects are automatically passed by reference. In PHP4, since objects are passed by copy, answer would be 10, 10 ^^

20,20 is the right answer.I have checked it on php-cli.

3. 20, 20 is correct.

Running the code will show that 3. is the correct answer. <br/><br/>$obj_one->changeValue(20, $obj_two); changes the value of $obj_two to 20 by reference.<br/><br/>$obj_two->changeValue($obj_two->getValue(), $obj_one); gets the newly assigned value of 20 from $obj_two, and then changes the value of $obj_one to 20 by reference.

anonymous, the answer to your question is this line from the manual: "Objects of the same type will have access to each others private and protected members even though they are not the same instances."

3 (20,20) is the correct answer without doubt.

I've tried it: 3. 20,20. The object will be passed as reference.

Hey, why 'private' is not working? I should not be able to access $obj_one->a at all.

Correct option is 3 (20,20). Objects are always passed as reference.
