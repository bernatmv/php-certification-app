The use of ".=" forces PHP to treat $oranges as a string, not a number.  So you get "5" . "1", or "51".  The echo() then uses "$apples++"; as this is a post-increment, it means that $apple is incremented *after* the echo() call is finished.  So "51" is printed to screen and $apples then holds the (numeric) value of 52.

sorry mate, its 51. its to do with the ++ being after the $apples. which echoes the apples then ads one to it afterward.

5 is the correct answer. Ther is no return at the function. so the final value is 5.
