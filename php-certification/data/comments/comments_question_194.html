thats a stupid question, but in the context of a software engineer test, only 2 can be the expected answer.

it depends on the project... i will select "1" if i need something to be done quick and need performance, i wont use any frameworks or design patterns, i just code... if it is for a customer and the code should be clean and easy to maintain, i would select 2.

I would say performance for sure and then make sure the code is maintainable.

This is an odd question, as 1 and 2 are effectively duplicated by 3 and 4.  In the general case, I'd suggest that ensuring the code is maintainable comes before performance, but there's a lot of potential exceptions to that rule.
