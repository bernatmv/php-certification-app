#5 is wrong for two reasons, first because it needs an echo or print to send the result to the screen. Second, because $oranges, and $apples are in the wrong order.

Correct answer is only 3. sprintf function doesn't print data, it will return them.

1. str_format() function doesen't even exist, unles you define one.<br/>2. print, print's parse error.<br/>3. CORRECT<br/>4. just print's number 5 <br/>5. sprintf doesent print anything. and beside, the argument's passed to it are in wrong order, even if it did worked, it would say "I have 10 apples and 5 oranges".

printf($string, $apples, $oranges);<br/>print sprintf($string,$apples,$oranges);<br/>So answers are 3 NOT 5

sprintf() returns a formated string, so you need to store in a variable first.<br/><br/>$test = sprintf($string,  $apples, $oranges); <br/>print $test;

<p>
1. Call to undefined function<br/>2. Syntax error at ,<br/>3. CORRECT<br/>4. outputs just "5" as $apples is the Format String<br/>5. outputs nothing as it just returns the result<br/>-> The "Choose 2 answers" is wrong!
