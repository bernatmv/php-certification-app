I think that the key word of question is "pattern". explode doesn't work with reg. expr. patterns, preg_split does. By the way "-=-" is a valid pattern. It splits string 'a=b' with array('a' => 'b'). So my answer is 3.

ALL FALSE ... so It must be 4 (missing comma is not part of the test apparently)

<p>
if missing comma in the 4th answer is not a misprint, than #2 is ok, otherwise #4 is better answer

#4 is right asumming the missing comma is a typo. #3 can never be right because the '-' on each side is the delimiter, so won't be matched.

#3 is correct answer, and #4 will never be correct because it misses "comma" between the pattern and string

Correct is 4. In the number 3, the regular expression is wrong. In the number 2, lenght of string is unknown and it maybe have more than "-=-" pattern.

The lenght of the string is unknown. Let take 'abcde-=-qwerty'<br/>2: Array ([0] => abcde [1] => -=-qw [2] => erty) -> WRONG.<br/>3: Array ([0] => abcde- [1] => -qwerty) -> much better than 2, but also WRONG.<br/>4: syntax error. But if there will be a comma it is the best answer.<br/>So there is a mistake in answers. The correct answer is 3 or 4, but never 1 and 2.

Typo in answer #4, but it is the correct one. #2 does not remove the "-=-" pattern and #3 leaves both "-" since they are used as regex delimiter.

answer 2 is correct<br/>results:<br/>$string = 'abc-=-def';<br/>2 => Array ( [0] => abc [1] => -=- [2] => def )<br/>3 => Array ( [0] => abc- [1] => -def ) <br/>4 => syntax error missing ','

explode("-=-" $string); is the right answer as preg_split here misses the delimiter(or will mis-interpret '-' as delimiter)

2. does not return the first element due to the strpos -> WRONG<br/>3. lacks the "/" delimiter on both sides of the regex and thus splits just on "=" -> WRONG<br/>4. there is a comma missing before $string, else it would be the correct answer -> MAYBE?

The answer is 4. just test the code in PHP file
