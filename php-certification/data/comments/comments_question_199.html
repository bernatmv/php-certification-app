Most real applications I know don't use constants for storing passwords. They rather use some kind of configuration files, usually not php files, where credentials can be stored. For example xml, yml, ini and so on. Using environment variables for credentials also sounds strange and not flexible for me, so I assume that 1, 2 and 3 are correct ans.

I think 2,3,5 <br/>Moving all database credentials into a single file => no reason at all<br/>Setting creditial information as system environment variables => I dont see what be the porpose of that ? creating globals wont improve security i guess ? right ?<br/>Using PHP constants instead of variables to store credentials => it's a best pratice according to what i red on books

#1 does do jack shit. #5 also, for answers mentionned below. The best answers are 2,4,5.

2,3,4. 5 is bullshit. Malicious user != developer. If the user has access to your variables, then they have access to your constants as well...

1) doesn't directly improve security.  2) only works when your PHP install isn't restricted to the doc root (e.g. a chrooted PHP install won't be able to access the file either!).  3) will work (assuming there's no static content on the server), 4) should work, but is clumsy and depends on the system supporting env variables.  5) doesn't stop people reading your password details, but it does prevent them overwriting them.  So I'd suggest 2, 3 and 5 - with the caveats above in mind.
