it is not clear if the output should be ".net" or "net", but I also took other mockup tests and they want to get the top lever domain only, without the ".".  If the question would be get the domain of www.example.com would you get ".example" ? or "example"... -.- so yea, NR 4 is true.

Checked it, the exam never asks you to extract a TLD but instead asks to extract .com, which makes 5. the valid answer

PHP exam is not about knowing what a TLD is. Read the question, it basically asks how to get ".net" (including the dot) out of "john@php.net". So answer #5 is correct.

haha...why don't you check "TLD" on wikipedia...based on the site...the TLD of www.example.com is "com" (not .com)...so 4 wins!!!

substr($var, strpos($var, ".")); is the correct answer as we required ".net", not "net"

answer is 5.  substr($var, strpos($var, ".") + 1); = "net" and not ".net"
