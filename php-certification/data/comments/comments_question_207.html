if #3 is eliminated as an answer because it will not work on FAT32, then #1 should be ruled out also because as the manual says (...it can be used on virtually any system (including most Unix derivates..))

3 is correct.  See the first note at http://es.php.net/manual/en/function.flock.php ... "flock() uses mandatory locking instead of advisory locking on Windows".

PHP supports locking on "virtually every platform, including Windows".  So the answer is #2, though it's worth noting that some options (e.g. LOCK_NB) may not work on some platforms.

I think 2 is right:<br/>flock() allows you to perform a simple reader/writer model which can be used on virtually every platform (including most Unix derivatives and even Windows).<br/><br/>May only be used on file pointers returned by fopen() for local files, or file pointers pointing to userspace streams that implement the streamWrapper::stream_lock() method.

I think its 1 because the question talks about --> assured to work <-- and flock can't work with fat32 (means cant work with windows)
