The problem is the parentheses around the return statement: http://php.net/manual/en/function.return.php

The code works with PHP 5.3 and there are thread on php-dev from 2004 that talk of an error when null is returned by reference. So I assume 5 is correct.

You can't return the result of an expression(in parentheses) by reference in PHP5. I suspect you can't do it in php4 either. This question is testing that principle. An uninitialized variable will default to null. I believe that you could pass a null reference in php4. So, that answer is clearly 1, None of the above.
