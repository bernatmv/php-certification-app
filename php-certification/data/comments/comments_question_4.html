3rd answer takes a pointer to the variable that causes the value changes in the iteration.

if you are using foreach and change the array, then php will use a copy of it. the best way is 2 $array[$i] = 2 if the array keys are numeric

the best answer is 3  because we need to modify the array it self when we retrieve it and the all other answers is just take a copy of the array we ca not modify the array it self .

The answer is 3).  The solution given for 2) only works if all of the keys in the array are numeric.  4) would also work, but requires the user to explicitly reference the array in the foreach loop's body.

The key here is "best way" and "PHP 5" so obviously, the answer is 3...actually numbers 2, 3 and 5 can be the answer but 3 is the best.

3. sounds best as in PHP5 using &$val you can modify the values while iterating with foreach()

I think that is bether 2 option because in 3 you can't asign any value to $val after foreach!!!!
