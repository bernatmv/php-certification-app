to comment posted on 29 May 2010: the link you provide does have the answer. But the answer given is output buffering, not header buffering.

correct answer is 3. You can use output buffering to get around this problem, with the overhead of all of your output to the browser being buffered in the server until you send it. You can do this by calling ob_start() and ob_end_flush() in your script, or setting the output_buffering configuration directive on in your php.ini or server configuration files.

While output buffering is active no output is sent from the script (other than headers), instead the output is stored in an internal buffer.<br/><br/>from here:http://php.net/manual/en/function.ob-start.php
