Cryptography Extensions (hash) is not part of the exam BTW. That leaves md5().

Very confusing question.  "Determined" can mean "set" as in creating, or "ascertained" as in cracking...

1. "md5()" is a correct answer although starting with PHP 5.1.2 there is in fact a hash() function from the Hash extension (which internally uses md5, sha1 or others). I guess the test is just too old :)
