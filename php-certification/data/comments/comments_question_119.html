4 and 5 - why do people say 1 ? i have never seen an error which contained some session information, not even the session id.

#1 is a correct statement, as per the note below, but #5 is more correct.

nowhere does it say in answer #1 that error message will ALWAYS contain sensitive session information. It says it will. And if it will contain sensitive info 1 out of 100 times, that's still a correct statement.

1 is wrong, because error NOT always contains session information.<br/>2 and 3 are nonsence.<br/>4 is right. User shoud not see ugly error messages.<br/>5 is right. Error information can contain passwords or attacker can see web root path, and so on.

Maybe the question is not very well formulated and they want to know why it is not ok to show errors but it is ok to log them. In this case answers would be 5 and 3<br/>

1. and 5. would be a bit redundant.<br/>I ruled out 1. because they just "can" but not always "will" and would go instead with 2.

i think here is 1 and 5, see 4, "perception of insecurity to the user" ?
