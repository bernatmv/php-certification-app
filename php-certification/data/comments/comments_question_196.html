If we need three answers, then #2 has to be right, it's the only key with value 2. If #2 is right, then #5 is automatically wrong. #1 has to be right, because if it is wrong, then #3 and #4 are both right, and that makes no sense, since their messages are the same. Since #1 is right, #3 is automatically wrong since it's the same key, that leaves #4. (I'm just giving you another say to solve these questions on the real exam rather than to only rely on your memory)
