by process of elimination.. 5 is wrong because at least one answer is correct. 1 is correct, we can access each character in a string the same way we access indexes in an array. 2 would be correct if the function returned to a variable. 3 gives an error for empty delimiter. 4 is wrong because that constant doesn't exist.

1 give us a variable but all letters in one string. Is it independently?<br/>2 give us an array like 0 => A etc so it's that we need<br/>3 give us error: explode function doesn't accept empty delimiter<br/>4 is this constant exists? i can's find any info about this constant.<br/>5 is incorrect because at least answer 2 is correct<br/>So 100% correct only 2, maybe correct 1.

2 and 3 results aren't stored in a variable. Only #1 does that

explode function doesn't accept empty delimiter - It's true.
