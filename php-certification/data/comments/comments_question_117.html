I think, in the document root - not in parallel or higher level directory, but in document root, where are all scripts of project. Off course not directly in document root, but in some nested directory.

users can easily access files that are in the document root. so, it is safe to place configuration and log files outside of the document roots. and you can use those file by using include/require or better to use include_once/require_once.

#1 is correct. I can have a private folder with php files next to my document root folder (httpdocs, public_html, etc...)
