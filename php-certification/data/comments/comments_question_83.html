Real output:<br/>string(78) "bI like PHP  I think it is cool/b"<br/>bI like 'PHP'  I think it is cool/bint(1)

var_dump(htmlentities($string, ENT_QUOTES)) produce *** string(78) "I like 'PHP' & I think it is "cool"  ***<br/>var_dump(print htmlspecialchars($string)) produce *** I like 'PHP' & I think it is "cool"int(1) ***<br/><br/>Again that question is not right, and contains a error;<br/><br/>If there was no "print" function in the second vardump, then answer will be 4 since the htmlentities does not convert quotes thanks to the ENT_QUOTES parameter ...

If #1 were reworded to say the htmlentities() call will translate the single quotes, while the htmlspecialchars() call will not, then #1 would be the correct answer. Otherwise, all answers are wrong.

It mustn't have a print in "var_dump(print htmlspecialchars($string))", then without this print "var_dump(htmlspecialchars($string),ENT_QUOTES)" produces the same result so the right answer is "4"

#1, htmlspecialchars() does not translate the quotes.

I guess the difference in string length is dur to print in htmlspecialchars, if it is removed both strings give 78 as length.so ans is 4

output:<br/><br/>string(78) "bI like PHP  I think it is cool/b"<br/><br/>and<br/><br/>bI like 'PHP'  I think it is cool/bint(1)<br/><br/>as you can see it's not the same. Answer is 1 quotes are not translated by htmlspecialchars()

did test, and as human being the result seems to be the same, therefore answer 4.but I do not understand why the string length is not the same:<br/>I like 'PHP' & I think it is "cool" length:78I like 'PHP' & I think it is "cool" length:68<br/>78 vs 68?<br/>Can anyone tell me this secret

1. *is* the correct answer:<br/>string(78) "bI like PHP  I think it is cool/b"<br/><br/>string(68) "bI like 'PHP'  I think it is cool/b"<br/><br/>(the print inside the var_dump is wrong but that probably does not matter here)

1 is the correct answer, htmlspecialchars() needs ENT_QUOTES too for translating the '' quotes.
