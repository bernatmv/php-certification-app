^([a-z]{5}) matches exactly 5 lower case letters at the start of the string. [1-5]+ matches one or more numbers from 1 to 5. So far this eliminates #2, because of the uppercase H. It eliminates #5 because there are more than 5 lowercase letters at the start of the string. The last part of the regular expression means at least one lowercase letter. #3 and #4 meet all criteria. And that automatically eliminates #1.
