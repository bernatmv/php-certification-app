#1: does not exist (http://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html).<br/><br/>#2 is DEPRECATED (http://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_count_changes)<br/><br/>#3: good<br/><br/>#4: contrast of #3 (wrong answer)<br/><br/>#5:  does not exist (http://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html).<br/><br/>So this question is outdated (as of 2012. oct.), but possibly 2 and 3 were the good answers.
