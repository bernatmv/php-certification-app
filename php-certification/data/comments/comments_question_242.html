The answer is 0 as function b is taking variable by reference and return nothing or null , which is converted to 0 ( type juggling )

1 is correct.  Only variables can be passed by reference, and in this case, a number is being passed (5).

This one has to be read carefully.  b() takes a reference to $number, so it does increment $number when called.  However, a() tries to use the *return* value from b(); as one is not provided, the default value NULL is returned.  This results in a() trying to calculate "NULL * $number", which results in a value of 0.

Option 1. is right, because function b() does not return

0 is the right answer as function b() does not have a return value.  If there is a return statement, the answer will be 36.

1 is the correct answer, b($number) doesn't return a number so we are trying to return (INT)NULL*6=0*6....
