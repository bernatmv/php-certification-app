PHP 5 supports giving referenced variables a default value, so $variable is set to 5.  Then, as the echo uses a pre-increment call (i.e. ++$variable, not $variable++), $variable is incremented before it's used by echo().  So the output is 6.

To bad every idiot can give an answer here (I'm pointing @ anonymous from 26 Nov). You just gave a good answer why is option 3 and not 2 like he said.

Not answer 3. The correct answer is 2 becouse ++$variable and not $variable++
