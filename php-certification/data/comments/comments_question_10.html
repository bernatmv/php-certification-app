The correct answer is 1 refer to type hinting in php manual. 5 is not correct because you cant define an user-created object as the parameter.

The correct answer is 4 but I suspect that is not what was intended, just a badly written question.  Type hinting does not ensure that you are passed an "object", it raises a fatal error if you are not passed a "specific object".  Answer 3 is incorrect, because by the time we can use this check "The incorrect type has already been passed".  Trick question or perhaps badly worded?

The answer correct is using the funcion is_object. Option 3.

1 and 5 are right. But I agree, the question is epic fail.

The only way to ensure it is using is_object function inside user-defined function. Because a user-defined class isn't child of stdClass. PHP doesn't have a "Object" class too.

stdClass not a special system class, but some user-defined class (something like Foo). But Object is some user-created object, NOT class name. is_object() may return FALSE even if $a is an object (read manual once again). So the right answer is 1.

Answer one is type casting, not type hinting. Try<br/>class Foo{}<br/>$foo = new Foo();<br/>echo ($foo instanceof stdClass)?'Y':'N';<br/>The output is 'N'.

the question is about type hinting and the answer is a). For more see http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.typehinting.php

This is an ambiguous question.  If the question is "how to check for a specific class", then 1) or 5) could be used - both refer to a user-defined class.  However, in the general case, Option 3) is the best answer, though it's debatable how useful it is to know that the variable is an object if you don't actually know what properties and methods it has...

Both 1 and 5 cannot be correct because the only check if the argument is of exactly the one given class. ("Object" is a class name like any other and no reserved word like in Java).<br/>2. is a default initializer and no check<br/>3. is possible and at least better than 4.

<p>
Both 1 and 5 are correct.<br/>We can`t overwrite stdClass, so I think the more appropriate answer should be (5), because we can make a class named Object, so such object can be passed to the function.<br/><br/> <br/><br/><br/>

I think it's #3, first option only checks if argument is standard php object, not any object
