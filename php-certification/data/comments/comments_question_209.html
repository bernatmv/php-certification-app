The answer is 2, because the Host request-header was introduced in HTTP/1.1 to facilitate name-based virtual hosting.

i think the answer is 2 also, because it doesent matter for this script if request is blocking, it's default nature is to block unless you set it otherwise. but your HTTP request need's to be wellformed, or you're s***** ^^' but that's just my opinion ^^

fread() and fgets() are functionally the same; fread() is binary safe.  Similarly, fputs() and fwrite are synonyms.  This leaves 1) and 2) as possible answers; 1) is true (the request is blocking) but 2) is also true, as the request string needs a double newline at the end for the server to recognise it as a valid request (e.g. "GET / HTTP/1.0 \n\n") - "\r\n" is a windows newline, not a double newline.  So I'd suggest 2) as the answer...

I think, it's 2. Because HTTP request must be ended with double "\n" or "\r\n"

I think the answer is 3. fsockopen() returns a file pointer which may be used together with the other file functions (such as fgets(), fgetss(), fwrite(), fclose(), and feof()). http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.fsockopen.php
