static methods can be accessed by $this in php 5.3 from inside the class using another method.. and it can also be accessed by an object.. but we cannot call any other method or property from inside the static method using $this

<p>
if a static method had access to $this, then you wouldn't be able to call it statically, since $this refers to an instance.

static methods are callable without an instance of the object created, the pseudo-variable $this is not available inside the method declared as static

It is 2. Read the manual on php.net.<br/>Because static methods are callable without an instance of the object created, the pseudo-variable $this is not available inside the method declared as static.<br/>http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.static.php<br/>

Number 2("Static methods do not provide a reference to $this") is the correct answer.
