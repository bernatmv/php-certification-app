DTD is document type definition,i think here document types mean data with the same name,thus namespaces :-?

the questions says two different document types, not two different namespaces. A zend engineer can be wrong.

#4 Namespaces is correct answer, because it avoids any potential naming conflicts when two elements of the same<br/>name exist yet contain different types of data

From Wikipedia: "A Document Type Definition (DTD) is a set of markup declarations that define a document type..." Note that document type is singular. The way the question is written implies the would be two DTDs in a single XML document. Is this even possible? I think this question is talking about namespaces, but just poorly phrased. I am not an XML expert, if someone has other info please supply a link to your proof so we can settle the answer this question.

#4 is correct, since it can happen to have any potential naming conflicts

The question is badly phrased.  If you're trying to validate an XML document, then DTD is the answer, as they can be used to flag up invalid elements.  If you're trying to have "duplicate" data from multiple sources in a single document, then the answer is namespaces.  I'd be inclined to think the question is asking about validation and answer DTDs, but it's a guess...
