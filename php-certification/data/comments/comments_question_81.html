php doc says that strcmp is binary safe, so I assume #1 is right.

According to this question the right answer is '3', toveriffy just executes strcmp(1,'1') which returns 0 that's false in binary comparison since they're same Type

This question is wrong on the practice exam. The question states two variables, not strings. strcmp and strcasecmp only compare strings, they don't offer the same behaviour for other types such as arrays and objects which also can be contained within a variable. The valid answer here is 3.
