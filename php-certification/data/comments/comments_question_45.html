If you don't ever trust any data from the user, then you will always be filtering it, so 2 and 4 are the same thing in my book.

number 2. Number 4 is also good, but because 2 is a broader set of number 4, the correct one is 2.

Always filter all incoming data give us best security but we need BALANCE, so we can trust data comes from another modules but we must control all user input. So answer is 2: Never trust any data from the user

I incline to think 2, can you filter a FILE (a FILE is data from the user) ? Does this make sense ? ... 2 seems more politically correct
