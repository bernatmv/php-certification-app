Yes, it's 1,3 and 4. That's really tricky, cause as juice mentioned it is a Zend-related question.

Note that this is referring to the internal VM used by the Zend engine, not the PHP language.  Goto, Switch and Call are the new models; the Goto VM runs faster than Switch, which is faster than Call, but takes longer to compile.  See http://devzone.zend.com/article/459
