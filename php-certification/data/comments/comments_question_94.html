The question is NOT asking which function to call if you want to change the session id. It is asking how you change which function is called for generation of the session id. Tricky, and the link on the previous comment is all the proof you need that #1 is the answer.

The question is NOT abount changing session id, but abount FUNCTION to do this. There is no function in PHP that could register custom session handler. So, answer 5 not full. You must not only impement handler, but also 'Set the session id by force using the session_id() function'. Or you can use INI directive to change function from md5() to sha1().

To change the generation function from md5() to sha1() answer 1 would be the easiest. <br/>To change it to any other arbitrary function you would have to generate the id yourself and set it via session_id() i.e. answer 3.<br/>Hard to tell if the question was meant specific or universal...

3 is right : session_id() is used to get or set the session id for the current session ...from php.net
