First the delimiters are # characters (you may know this as a pound or a hash, depending where your English is from).  These are valid delimiters, the only requirement is that whatever you pick to put at the start must be matched at the end. \nThe delimiters have spaces inside them, so there must be spaces at the start and end of any matches.  Then we must have any number of word characters – the ? after the * means that the match isn't greedy (this happens again towards the end of the pattern) – followed by any two vowels, then any more word characters.\nThe first match is \" moose \" but this uses up the space before \"loose\", so that can't match, but \" about \" does, but \"house\" which looks like it should match is missing the trailing space.\nStill with me?  preg_match_all returns results in a nested array – the first element contains an array of all matches."]
